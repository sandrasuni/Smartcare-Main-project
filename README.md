INTRODUCTION 

Healthcare systems are fundamental to ensuring the well-being of communities by addressing a wide range of medical and public health needs. In recent years, technology has played a transformative role in streamlining healthcare delivery, enabling better communication, coordination, and management of services. This healthcare management system is designed to cater to various stakeholders, including patients, healthcare professionals, and administrators, fostering efficiency and reliability in healthcare management.

The system empowers patients by allowing them to register and log in to access their personal health records, view and manage their medical information, upload lab reports, search for doctors by name, and submit feedback or complaints regarding healthcare services. Administrators are provided with tools to manage registered members and handle complaints and feedback, ensuring smooth operations and user satisfaction.

Healthcare providers benefit from specialized functionalities that support their responsibilities. Public Health Nurses (PHNs) can schedule healthcare visits for maternal and bedridden patients, track and update vaccination records, review and manage scheduled visits, and monitor ASHA worker attendance using face recognition technology. Junior Health Inspectors (JHIs) register patients for vaccination, monitor disease outbreaks, generate reports, and mark attendance using face recognition. Doctors access patient health histories using unique health IDs, prescribe medications, oversee staff attendance, and contribute to healthcare service improvement.

ASHA workers maintain patient records, track child growth metrics, and manage visits for bedridden patients while marking attendance using face detection. Pharmacists ensure the availability of medicines by managing inventory records, issuing medicines based on prescriptions, and maintaining stock levels while marking attendance through face recognition. All stakeholders, including healthcare providers and administrators, can provide feedback or submit complaints to enhance system efficiency.

By integrating advanced features such as facial recognition for attendance tracking, real-time updates on vaccination coverage, and seamless prescription management, the system ensures effective and efficient healthcare service delivery. This collaborative and technology-driven approach bridges the gap between healthcare providers and patients, ultimately enhancing public health infrastructure and improving patient outcomes.
