INTRODUCTION 

Healthcare systems are fundamental to ensuring the well-being of communities by addressing a wide range of medical and public health needs. In recent years, technology has played a transformative role in streamlining healthcare delivery,enabling better communication,coordination, and management of services. This system is designed to cater to various stakeholders, including users, healthcare professionals, and administrators, fostering efficiency and reliability in healthcare management.The user module provides individuals with access to their health records, enabling them to view, update, and manage their personal medical information conveniently. Features like doctor searches, lab report uploads, and complaint submission ensure that users are empowered to take charge of their health while receiving the support they need.For healthcare providers, specialized modules are developed to address their specific roles and responsibilities. Public Health Nurses (PHNs) can schedule healthcare visits, track vaccinations, and ensure timely service delivery through automated systems. Junior Health Inspectors (JHIs) are equipped to manage vaccination schedules, monitor disease outbreaks,and generate reports, aiding in preventive healthcare measures. Doctors can access patient health histories securely, prescribe medications, and oversee staff attendance, enabling ac-
curate diagnosis and treatment.

Additionally, ASHA workers contribute by maintaining records of patient data, tracking child growth metrics, and managing visits for bedridden patients. Pharmacists ensure the smooth functioning of medicine inventories by updating stock records, issuing prescriptions, and managing inventory alerts. These interconnected modules are supported by the admin module, which facilitates overall system monitoring, complaint resolution, and efficient coordination among stakeholders.

By integrating features like facial recognition for attendance tracking, real-time updates on vaccination coverage, and seamless prescription management, the system ensures that healthcare services are delivered effectively and efficiently. Through this collaborative approach, the system bridges the gap between technology and healthcare, ultimately improving patient outcomes and enhancing public health infrastructure.
